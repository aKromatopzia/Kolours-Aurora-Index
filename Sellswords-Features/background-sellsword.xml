			<p>Each part of your character’s origin reflects facets of your character, their life, and the circumstances that started them on the path to adventure.</p>
			<p class="indent">While I would really love to make this the more complicated setup that they've got going on with 5.5 proper, the fact of the matter is that I'll go insane, so to compromise, go ahead and pick:</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li>An Origin Feature</li>
				<li>Two skill proficiencies of your choice</li>
				<li>A tool proficiency of your choice</li>
				<li>50 GP, if this is a new character</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The rest of the new rules really cut out a whole lot of what was going on with backgrounds, so now I've got a ton of blank space to leave here. Hi.</p>
